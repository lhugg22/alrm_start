# alrm_start
This code is to make an application for alarming on an android phone.

The goal is to have an app that doesn't allow you to turn the alarm off without
unlocking your phone, navigating to the app, and turning it off.

When setting up the alarm, you can decide how many times you can snooze the alarm via a seek bar.
You can also decide how many minutes to snooze on a seek bar when setting up the alarm.

Currently this only works with one alarm. And the alarm has to be set for today or tomorrow. But these will change soon hopefully.
